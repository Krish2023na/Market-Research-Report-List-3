<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Dies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser Hardened</li><li>Not Laser Hardened</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible dies for die cutting in the printing industry come in two main market types: laser hardened and not laser hardened. Laser hardened dies are treated with a laser to increase their durability and lifespan, making them ideal for high-volume or complex die cutting jobs. On the other hand, not laser hardened dies are more cost-effective but may not last as long or perform as well under heavy use. Both types of dies have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the job at hand.</p></p>
