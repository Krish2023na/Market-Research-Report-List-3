<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporaty Shoulder Spacers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementless</li><li>Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cementless shoulder spacers are used in joint replacement surgeries where the prosthetic components are designed to press-fit into the bone without the need for cement. This type of spacer allows for bone ingrowth and natural fixation. On the other hand, cemented shoulder spacers involve the use of bone cement to secure the prosthetic components in place. Cemented spacers provide immediate fixation and stability but may require revision surgery in the future. Both types of spacers have their own advantages and considerations for patients undergoing shoulder joint replacement.</p></p>
