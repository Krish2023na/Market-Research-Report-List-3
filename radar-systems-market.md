<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulsed Radar</li><li>Continuous Wave (CW) Radar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radar systems can be classified into two main market types: Pulsed Radar and Continuous Wave (CW) Radar. Pulsed Radar uses short bursts of high-power radio frequency energy to transmit signals and measure the time it takes for the signals to return after hitting a target, providing range and velocity measurements. On the other hand, Continuous Wave (CW) Radar emits a continuous signal without interruption and relies on Doppler frequency shift to detect the movement of objects. Both types of radar systems have specific applications and advantages in different industries.</p></p>
