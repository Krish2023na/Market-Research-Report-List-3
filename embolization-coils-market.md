<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolization Coils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Pushable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embolization coils are used in the treatment of aneurysms and other vascular conditions. There are two main types of embolization coils on the market: detachable and pushable coils. Detachable coils can be easily deployed and retrieved from the blood vessel, allowing for precise placement and repositioning as needed. Pushable coils, on the other hand, are more rigid and are advanced through the catheter by pushing, providing stable embolization. Both types of coils offer different advantages and are used based on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure.</p></p>
