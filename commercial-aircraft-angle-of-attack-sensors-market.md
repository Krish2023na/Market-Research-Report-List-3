<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aircraft Angle of Attack Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vane angle of attack sensor</li><li>Zero pressure angle of attack sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial aircraft angle of attack sensors can be categorized into two main types: vane angle of attack sensors and zero pressure angle of attack sensors. Vane sensors use a physical vane to measure the angle of airflow relative to the aircraft's longitudinal axis. On the other hand, zero pressure sensors use pressure measurements to determine the angle of attack. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in providing accurate data to the aircraft's flight control systems, ensuring safe and efficient operation.</p></p>
