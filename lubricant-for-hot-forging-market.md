<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lubricant for Hot Forging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Containing Graphite Lubricant for Hot Forging</li><li>Graphite Free Lubricant for Hot Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lubricants for hot forging can be classified into two main types based on their composition: those containing graphite and those that are graphite-free. Graphite lubricants are commonly used in hot forging processes due to their high temperature resistance and ability to reduce friction between the die and workpiece. On the other hand, graphite-free lubricants offer environmental benefits and are suitable for applications where graphite contamination needs to be avoided. Both types of lubricants play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and quality of hot forging operations.</p></p>
