<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Burnt Magnesium Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lightly Burnt Powder</li><li>Reburned Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Burnt magnesium oxide market includes lightly burnt powder and reburned powder. Lightly burnt powder is a type of magnesium oxide that undergoes a mild burning process, resulting in a partially burnt consistency with a lighter color and lower reactivity. On the other hand, reburned powder goes through a secondary burning process to further enhance its properties, such as increased purity and reactivity. Both types cater to different industrial applications based on their specific characteristics and properties.</p></p>
