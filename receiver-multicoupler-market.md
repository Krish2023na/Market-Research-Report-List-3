<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Receiver Multicoupler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Multicouplers</li><li>Active Multicouplers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Receiver multicouplers are devices used to split and distribute incoming signals to multiple receivers. There are two main types of multicouplers in the market - passive and active. Passive multicouplers simply split the signal without any amplification, while active multicouplers not only split the signal but also amplify it to maintain signal strength. Passive multicouplers are usually less expensive and simpler, while active multicouplers are more complex and are often used in larger scale applications where signal loss needs to be minimized.</p></p>
