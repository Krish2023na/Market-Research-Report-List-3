<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Arc Furnaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC-EAF</li><li>DC-EAF</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are used for steelmaking and metal production. There are two main types of EAFs - AC-EAF and DC-EAF. AC-EAFs use alternating current to generate arcs between electrodes and the metal charge, while DC-EAFs use direct current for the same purpose. AC-EAFs are more widely used due to their lower cost and simpler operation, while DC-EAFs are favored for their higher efficiency and better control over the melting process. Both types have their own advantages and applications in the metal industry.</p></p>
