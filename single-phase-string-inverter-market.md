<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-Phase String Inverter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid</li><li>Off-Grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-phase string inverters are widely used in both on-grid and off-grid solar power systems. On-grid inverters are connected to the utility grid and are designed to feed excess solar power back into the grid. They are commonly used in residential and commercial buildings where the grid connection is available. On the other hand, off-grid inverters are used in standalone solar power systems where there is no grid connection available. These inverters store excess solar power in batteries for later use, making them ideal for remote locations or areas with unreliable grid power.</p></p>
