<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind-driven Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asynchronous Wind-driven Generator</li><li>Synchronous Wind-driven Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind-driven generators can be classified into two main types: asynchronous and synchronous generators. Asynchronous wind-driven generators operate without the need for a connection to the grid and are commonly used in off-grid applications. On the other hand, synchronous wind-driven generators are directly connected to the grid and are able to maintain a constant output frequency. Both types of generators play a crucial role in harnessing wind energy and converting it into electricity for residential, commercial, and industrial applications.</p></p>
