<p><strong>The Cold Caps and Scalp Cooling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scalp Cool Caps</li><li>Scalp Cool Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cold caps and scalp cooling systems are devices used during chemotherapy to reduce hair loss. Scalp cool caps are worn directly on the head, while scalp cooling systems circulate a coolant through a cap to maintain a consistent temperature. Both work by constricting blood vessels in the scalp, reducing the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach the hair follicles. Scalp cooling systems are generally more effective but are also more expensive. The market for these devices continues to grow as more cancer patients seek options to preserve their hair during treatment.</p></p>
