<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MGO Thermocouples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grounded Type</li><li>Ungrounded Type</li><li>Exposed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MGO thermocouples are commonly classified into three types based on their construction: grounded, ungrounded, and exposed. Grounded MGO thermocouples have the junction welded to the sheath, providing good thermal contact for accurate measurements. Ungrounded MGO thermocouples have the junction insulated from the sheath, reducing electrical interference but also increasing response time. Exposed MGO thermocouples have the junction exposed to the environment, offering fast response times but requiring protection from harsh conditions. Each type has its own advantages and is suited for different applications.</p></p>
