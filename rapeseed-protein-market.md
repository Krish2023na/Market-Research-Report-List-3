<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rapeseed Protein Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrolyzed Rapeseed Protein</li><li>Rapeseed Protein Isolate Product</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rapeseed protein market is divided into two main types - Hydrolyzed Rapeseed Protein and Rapeseed Protein Isolate. Hydrolyzed Rapeseed Protein undergoes a process where the protein is broken down into smaller peptides, making it easier for the body to absorb. On the other hand, Rapeseed Protein Isolate is a pure form of protein extracted from rapeseed, containing a higher protein content compared to hydrolyzed rapeseed protein. Both types cater to different consumer needs and preferences in the protein supplement market.</p></p>
