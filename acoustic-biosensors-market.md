<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acoustic Biosensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) Sensor</li><li>Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acoustic biosensors are classified into two main types: Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) Sensor and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensor. QCM sensors measure the changes in mass on a quartz crystal surface, which occur due to the binding of target molecules. SAW sensors, on the other hand, utilize acoustic waves propagating along the surface of a piezoelectric material to detect the binding of molecules. Both types of sensors are widely used in various applications such as medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety.</p></p>
